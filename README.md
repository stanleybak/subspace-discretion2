# Discretion 2

Discretion 2 is a [SubSpace](http://subspace-continuum.com/) client made to work with a minimally modified [ASSS](http://asss.minegoboom.com/) server. The main goal of this project is to explore if completely sever-side physics is possible while retaining the expected SubSpace player experience. This idea is inspired by [this set of blog posts](http://gafferongames.com/networked-physics/introduction-to-networked-physics/) on networks physics. 

Some of the code is reused from my earlier SubSpace client project, [Discretion](http://ss-discretion.sourceforge.net/).
