# Discretion Two

This is a subspace client made to work with a minimally modified ASSS server. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate if completely sever-side physics is possible while retaining reasonable responsiveness. This idea is based on the discussion at this blog post: http://gafferongames.com/networked-physics/introduction-to-networked-physics/ 

Some of the code is reused from my earlier subspace client attempt, Discretion: http://ss-discretion.sourceforge.net/
